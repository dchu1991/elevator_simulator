# Skills that would enhance this project

1. Optimization/Algorithm Design
    - Implementing more sophisticated elevator dispatching algorithms (SCAN, LOOK, destination dispatch)
    - Optimizing the scoring system for better performance
    - Implementing machine learning for traffic prediction

2. Concurrent Programming
    - Better thread synchronization and lock management
    - Async/await patterns for I/O operations
    - Handling race conditions more elegantly

3. Data Analysis & Visualization
    - More sophisticated statistical analysis
    - Real-time graphing of performance metrics
    - Heat maps showing traffic patterns over time

4. Testing & Quality Assurance
    - Property-based testing for elevator logic
    - Load testing and stress testing
    - Performance profiling and benchmarking

5. System Design
    - Plugin architecture for swappable algorithms
    - Event-driven architecture
    - Better separation of concerns

6. UI/UX Design
    - More polished pygame visualization
    - Interactive configuration tools
    - Real-time debugging interface

Currently the project has good:
